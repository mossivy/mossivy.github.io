                  Notes from Robert Ivy, FAIA Editor-in-chief
               </div>

               <p>
                  8:48 AM We gathered at 55 Water Street in the Standard &
                  Poor's conference center. The view of Manhattan from the 37th
                  floor was sparkling with sunlight and promise. To the left,
                  the out-of-towners gaped at Lady Liberty; to our right, the
                  flat-topped twin towers of the World Trade Center. As we
                  greeted our guests, a group of New York architects and fellow
                  workers, suddenly someone pointed out that papers were flying
                  outside the window: Had someone scattered confetti in the air?
                  Bit by bit, our conversation over coffee drifted off as we
                  turned toward the window. The expressions of twenty people
                  changed from amusement to bewilderment.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Instead of a colorful shower, the "confetti" consisted of
                  thousands of sheets of paper, working copies, apparently
                  sucked from the World Trade Center and cascading from an open
                  gash in the side of the building. Smoke began to pour from the
                  wound as we slowly sorted through events. Twenty eyes were
                  transfixed on the behemoth towers, as smoke began to pour out.
                  The south tower of the WTC had been hit, possibly by a bomb.
               </p>

               <p>
                  We were puzzling through the unfolding scene, when the
                  conference room phone rang out. Carol Kurth, an architect due
                  to join the meeting, was calling from a car in the street
                  below the building. She had seen it. A plane had hit the World
                  Trade Center.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Immediately we headed for the television. Had it been a
                  suicide? An intentional strike? A pilot who had blacked out?
                  Smoke built in intensity and flames were evident. Damage to
                  the sides of the tower included free-hanging pieces of metal
                  from the columns. Our meeting, which overlooked the
                  catastrophe, had come to an end.
               </p>

               <p>
                  9:06 Suddenly, someone in the group screamed out. A huge boom
                  shook the room as we turned to witness a full-sized jet
                  aircraft crash into the north tower of the WTC. I looked up to
                  see shards of the building fly out into space, felt the blow
                  to the building in my chest as the force reverberated with
                  sonic power, recoiled from the smoke and the attendant flash
                  of fire. We were under attack: at that instant, America, was
                  at war.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Quickly we evacuated the building. Rather than take the fire
                  stairs, which were not immediately apparent, we grabbed the
                  first elevator that stopped on 37. The facilities manager for
                  McGraw-Hill, who had been a participant, remained on the
                  telephone on the higher floor. Despite our fears of disrupted
                  power, the lift worked. At ground level, the scene was
                  pandemonium, as workers from hundreds of offices sought their
                  friends and decided where to go, what to do. As of yet, no
                  debris or dust clouded the eastern quadrant of lower Manhattan
                  as we struck out, headed north, away from the towers.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Although we had no direction from authorities, common sense
                  dictated that we follow the river north. Our group stuck
                  together, past the ferries, past the saline smells at the
                  Fulton Fish Market, at a quick pace, stopping briefly to wait
                  for stragglers.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Ironically, the sun shone bright as the day warmed up.
                  Throughout the trek north, we wondered if other targets or
                  other buildings would be hit? Were civilians on foot a
                  potential target? Ahead, the Brooklyn Bridge offered a choice.
                  My house lay across the East River in Brooklyn Heights, less
                  than a mile away. It was clear to me that the trophy targets
                  lay in Manhattan; quiet Brooklyn offered few attractions for
                  terrorists. I was heading home.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Two others in our group decided to join me in Brooklyn, two
                  people aimed for the Williamsburg Bridge, while the remainder
                  of the group determined to get as far north in Manhattan as
                  they could. We hugged and said goodbye, then turned back
                  toward the mid-island, looking for the on-ramps to the
                  Brooklyn Bridge, accompanied by sirens and shrieks of cars
                  headed out of town.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Imagine the scene: 3 men, one of whom was 83 years old,
                  threading our way up the massive on-ramp of the bridge,
                  walking between honking cars and throngs of pedestrians in
                  single file, never looking back. Ahead lay the pedestrian
                  walkway over the massive 1875 bridge that I know like a good
                  friend and home. The odds seemed good. Although the central
                  span of the bridge would be vulnerable to a strike, it would
                  only take ten minutes to cross from the granite piers to the
                  land. On the other shore lay Long Island and a more sheltered
                  world that seemed worth the effort.
               </p>

               <p>
                  The scene at the walkway was like the Exodus. The three of us,
                  in sport coats, encumbered with briefcases, clambered over a
                  low wall surmounted with cast iron grille, and joined a sea of
                  humanity leaving the city. Tens of thousands of people marched
                  in an orderly mass, quietly. The group reflected the diversity
                  of New York, from Hasidic Jews to Africans in full regalia to
                  Russians, Poles, and Puerto Ricans. Some were elderly, propped
                  up by compatriots, and flushed from heat and exertion. A few
                  kids jogged irregularly through the crowds. Everyone remained
                  calm; no one yelled.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Although it seemed impossible to stop for breath, at mid-point
                  in the bridge, we felt a rumble like faraway thunder and
                  turned. The impossible was happening. The south tower of the
                  World Trade Center shook, and in what resembled an elemental
                  act, fell to earth in a mighty shout. The entire dissolution,
                  the changeover from solid elements to ash, took only seconds,
                  and it was gone. A bronzed man lifted his hands with clinched
                  fists to the skies shrieked and yelled, "You bastards!" and
                  ran into the throng. Then in a few short steps we had reached
                  the shade of Cadman Plaza and safety while ash and smoke
                  billowed out like a land-borne cloud.
               </p>

               <p>
                  As an architect, l was amazed that these powerful structures,
                  surrounded by columns, had proved as vulnerable to exterior
                  movement as they had. Although the aircraft had exerted
                  tremendous forces, would the towers have fallen without some
                  additional explosives, or had something within the structures
                  caused the buildings to collapse? We subsequently learned, via
                  CNN, that they had been loaded with fuel. The planes had, in
                  effect, been bombs. Answers would demand another day and rest
                  and peace. For now, we had all become victims of an hour's
                  terror, aware that the nexus of urban civilization had been
                  shaken, and that we would all be changed.
